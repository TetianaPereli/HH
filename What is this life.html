<p>
What is this life if, full of care,<br>
We have no time to stand and stare.<br>
</p>
<p>
No time to stand beneath the boughs<br>
And stare as long as sheep or cows.<br>
</p>
<p>
No time to see, when woods we pass,<br>
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.<br>
</p>
<p>
No time to see, in broad daylight,<br>
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.<br>
</p>
<p>
No time to turn at Beauty’s glance,<br>
And watch her feet, how they can dance.<br>
</p>
<p>
No time to wait till her mouth can<br>
Enrich that smile her eyes began.<br>
</p>
<p>
A poor life this if, full of care,<br>
We have no time to stand and stare.<br>
</p>
